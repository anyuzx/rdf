rdf
===
Calculate the Radial Distribution Function from the HISTORY file generated by DL_POLY. Of course this can be easily
modified to be applied on any other format configuration files.

The core of calculating the RDF is to calculate the distances between all atoms pairs.This part is written by C++ and be
interfaced with Python using Cython. The reading file part is written in Python.

c_rdf.cpp and c_rdf.h are two source codes for calculating the distances between atoms pairs.
